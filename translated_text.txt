FADE IN

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

The sun shines brightly over the serene riverbank, casting a golden hue on the water. The sound of birds chirping fills the air, creating a peaceful atmosphere.

ACTION

Two figures approach the riverbank from opposite sides. As they draw closer, their faces become visible, revealing the wrinkles of age and the wisdom of experience.

CHARACTER - KUMAR

KUMAR, a middle-aged man with a determined look in his eyes, gazes at the river with a mix of nostalgia and longing.

DIALOGUE - KUMAR

KUMAR: (whispers to himself) It's been thirty years since I last stood here. So much has changed, yet this river remains the same.

CHARACTER - PRIYA

PRIYA, a woman of the same age as Kumar, walks towards him with a hesitant smile on her face. Her eyes reflect a mixture of joy and sadness.

DIALOGUE - PRIYA

PRIYA: (softly) Kumar, is that really you? After all these years?

KUMAR: (smiling) Priya, it's been too long. I never thought we would meet again, especially here.

PRIYA: (emotionally) This river holds so many memories for us. Remember how we used to play here as kids?

KUMAR: (nostalgically) How could I forget? Those were the best days of our lives.

INTERCUT - FLASHBACK

The scene transitions to a flashback of Kumar and Priya as children, laughing and splashing in the river, carefree and full of innocence.

SUBHEADER - PRESENT DAY

The flashback fades, bringing us back to the present day as Kumar and Priya stand side by side, lost in their memories.

KUMAR: (reflectively) Life took us on different paths, but somehow, we found our way back here.

PRIYA: (wistfully) It's like fate brought us together again, to remind us of where we came from.

KUMAR: (determined) And where we're going. We may be older now, but our spirits are still young.

PRIYA: (smiling) Let's make new memories by the river, Kumar. Let's reclaim our childhood joy.

KUMAR: (grinning) I couldn't think of a better way to spend the day, Priya.

The two friends embrace, their bond stronger than ever as they watch the sun set over the river, marking a new beginning in their lives.
